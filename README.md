# Heart Disease Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on detecting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project explores the use of various models and explainable AI (XAI) methods to improve the interpretability and reliability of predictions, helping to support early detection of heart disease.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a robust classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- Apply explainable AI techniques to make model predictions interpretable for healthcare providers.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks.
- **Explainable AI Techniques**: XAI methods like SHAP and LIME are used to provide insights into the factors influencing each prediction.
- **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results

The project includes visualizations and metrics to illustrate model performance, including:
- **Feature Importance**: Insights on which features contribute most to the model’s predictions.
- **Model Accuracy**: Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model reliability.
- **Explainability**: XAI methods provide clear, interpretable insights into the model’s decision-making process.
